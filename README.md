## Commit Structure

Conventional Commits are a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. They provide an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. In this project, I use the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) specification.

## Documentation

A MkDocs documentation in German is available at the [following repository](https://github.com/21r8390/M242-Doku).

## Snake in C

C was learned at the beginning in a game called Snake, which can be found at [this link](https://github.com/21r8390/SnakeC).
